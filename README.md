# Boggle Intl.
This is the full code for the Boggle Intl. Android App. The player can choose the board language to be 
either English (CA), French, or Spanish. 

The app uses a prefix search tree (also known as a Trie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), which enables it to find all the hidden words in a board in a fraction of a second.
